Deploy free Clamav antivirus to protect file system of your Linux server. 
Simply select **Scan Now** on the Addon once to get the options for scanning.

**Note:** 
* The Scan will severely load your node and it might be slow to respond during the scan or even be unresponsive.
* There is **NO** automatic Scanning.
* The Node needs at least 12 reserved Cloudlets to have enough RAM available for Clamav.
* If full node Scan is used, make sure the nothing is mounted which should not be scanned.
